# Text-games
This repository contains text game simulators for research purposes.

#### User-friendly version
If you just want to have a sense with what text-based games look like, you can try the following .html based version:
 - [Saving John](http://interactivestoryspace.appspot.com/final2_sjohn_jtsay.html)
 - [Machine of Death](http://ifarchive.giga.or.at/if-archive/games/competition2013/web/machineofdeath/MachineOfDeath.html)
 - [Fantasy World](http://horizondark.com:8000/webclient/) (Thanks to Karthik for providing the reference.)

#### Python simulators (under text-games/simulators/, Dependencies: Python 2.7)
This directory contains three text game simulators, including **Saving John** and **Machine of Death** mentioned in [1], and **Fantasy World** mentioned in [2].

**Saving John** and **Machine of Death** are converted from their original .html source codes. They are stand-alone simulators and should be easy to run from text-games/simulators/.

**Fantasy World** requires installing the [Evennia package and text-world](https://github.com/mrkulk/text-world).
